*Used a graduated cylinder as container. For other trials, used a 1L plastic jar. 

Note: the outflow tube wasn't straight for the 320cm and 260cm tests, which may have resulted in the large range of values. The outflow tube was straight for the 300cm trials, possibly resulting in the closer range of values.
