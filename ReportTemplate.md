## Abstract

The Spring 2018 Filter Constrictions subteam has worked to improve the model of floc deposition at a flow constriction. Specifically, the model mimics clay-sand interactions at constrictions between a filter's sand particles. The current model is comprised of an acrylic flow cell using a wire as a flow constrictor. The Spring 2018 team aims to adjust this design by altering its internal components and its geometry; the team also plans to better control the system flow. After these changes to the model and schematic, the flow cell will more accurately represent floc behavior in AguaClara's stacked rapid sand filters.

## Introduction
The Filter Constrictions subteam aims to evaluate the theory that flocs passing through sand filters deposit preferentially at flow constrictions. According to this theory, due to a constriction’s convergent streamlines, particles passing near a pore’s edge progressively draw closer to this edge and deposit. As particles accumulate, shrinking the constriction, collision frequency increases. The velocity through the constriction then increases until the drag force on the deposited particles is sufficient to rotate them through the constriction.

To evaluate this theory, the Filter Constrictions subteam will develop a method to model and analyze floc accumulation at a sand filter’s constriction points. This research will be applied to better understand the filtration process in AguaClara’s water treatment plants.

The Fall 2017 subteam built a flow cell reactor comprised of two clear acrylic blocks that were separated by a specially shaped layer of silicone, creating a channel 0.5 mm deep. A 0.3 mm diameter wire restricted flow, resulting in a 0.2 mm vertical channel for particles to flow through. The camera recorded what occurred at this constriction. In order to record a higher quality video to analyze flow and deposition, the subteam used red dye instead of clay to create flocs.

The Spring 2018 subteam determined that the wire constriction was insufficient to accurately model constrictions in a sand filter. Since the camera recorded perpendicularly to the flow cell and the wire lay horizontally across said cell, the constriction was outside the camera’s plane of view. Also, the wire-constriction was two-dimensional; when flocs deposited, flocs were able to pass around them in a path dissimilar to that in a sand filter. The Spring 2018 subteam aims to alter the flow cell to contain more realistic constrictions, all visible to the camera. Since the filter’s sand grains are 0.6 mm in diameter, due to the geometry of large quantities of sand particles, each constriction should result from a channel, 0.5 mm in diameter and in depth, and a flow restriction of radius 0.3 mm. The subteam must determine the most effective and efficient way to implement these parameters.


## Literature Review and Previous Work
Discuss what is already known about your research area based on both external work and that of past AguaClara Teams. Connect your objectives with what is already known and explain what additional contribution you intend to make. Make sure to add APA formatted in-text citations. If you mention the author(s) in your sentence, you can simply give the year of publication.[(Logan et. al. 1987)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25043431.pdf?acceptTC=true)

The Milli-Sedimentation Team in Fall 2016 found that when turbid water was passed through honeycomb structures that did not align, flocs were captured where the flow was constricted between honeycombs. Both the Milli-sed team and the StaRS Filter team provided evidence to help prove the filter constrictions hypothesis detailed in the introduction. [(Whiting et. al. 2016)](https://www.overleaf.com/8159891kkzwhhgszwtb#/28827379/) This was then tested using the precursor to the current flow cell model which used a singular wire constriction between two acrylic slabs, recorded with a camera. This showed that the flocs were depositing at the constriction, though it was unclear at which portion of the constriction this was occuring. These experiments also showed that

## Methods
Explain the techniques you have used to acquire additional data and insights. Reserve fine detail for the Manual at the end of the report, but use this section to give an overview with enough detail for the reader to understand your Results and Analysis. Describe your apparatus, and have a justification for every decision you made and every parameter you chose in the design of the apparatus. Be especially careful to detail the conditions your experiments were conducted under, as this information is especially important for interpreting your results

Below, some example sections are given. Sectioning the report is meant to keep similar information together.  Continue making sections as necessary, or delete sections if you do not need them. Feel free to add subsubsections to further delineate the information. For example, under the Experimental Apparatus section below, the EStaRS team might consider having sections such as "Filter Design" and "Filter Fabrication".

### Procedure
Discuss your experimental procedure. How did you run your experiment? What were you testing? What were the values of relevant parameters?

In order to observe the floc-sand interactions at a constriction, a flow cell was developed to model the microscale occurrence. The flow cell had clear acrylic walls to allow for video recordings of the events at the constriction. The recorded videos would allow for later analysis of the footage to test the hypothesis.

The system was set up in such a way that flocs would be developed in the flocculator preceding the flow cell and the floc behavior would then be recorded by a close-up camera set at the constriction of the flow cell. These experiments were run for durations up to an hour to observe the short term and long term events at the constriction.

In the past, the constriction was modeled through a 0.5 mm space created by a water-tight silicon spacer between the acrylic pieces where a 0.3 mm diameter wire created a 0.2 mm constriction between the acrylic walls of the cell. Though the flocs have historically been made of coagulant (PACl) and clay, the subteam recently chose to switch out the clay for red dye for increased floc visibility attributed to color contrast in the video footage.


## Results and Analysis

* new design possibilities
  - row of sand grains
  - creating one constriction column
    - issue talk about need to change velocity by manipulating height of head loss tubing

Present an observation (results), then explain what happened (analysis).  Each paragraph should focus on one aspect of your results. In that same paragraph, you should interpret that result.  
In other words, there should not be two distinct paragraphs, but instead one paragraph containing one result and the interpretation and analysis of this result. Here are some guiding questions for results and analysis:

When describing your results, present your data, using the guidelines below:
* What happened? What did you find?
* Show your experimental data in a professional way.




After describing a particular result, within a paragraph, go on to connect your work to fundamental physics/chemistry/statics/fluid mechanics, or whatever field is appropriate. Analyze your results and compare with theoretical expectations; or, if you have not yet done the experiments, describe your expectations based on established knowledge. Include implications of your results. How will your results influence the design of AguaClara plants? If possible provide clear recommendations for design changes that should be adopted. Show your experimental data in a professional way using the following guidelines:
* Why did you get those results/data?
* Did these results line up with expectations?
* What went wrong?
* If the data do not support your hypothesis, is there another hypothesis that describes your new data?

## Conclusions
Explain what you have learned and how that influences your next steps. Why does what you discovered matter to AguaClara?

Make sure that you defend your conclusions with facts and results.

## Future Work

* Increase length of microtubing
* Look into needle valve
* Find correct height for for the head loss tubing

* 1/32" silicone sheet
* 0.3mm diameter wire
* Ten screws
* Ten wingnuts
* Sand


### Model flocculator
* 3.5" diameter cylindrical cardboard tube

## Experimental Methods
### Set-up
1. Turn the valves of the inlet (Blue) and outlet (Red) hoses to the open positions (vertical handle).
  * If the dye and/or coagulant bottles are not connected to the system, replace the water bottles with the correct chemicals. See tube labeling to ensure proper correspondence of microtubing to chemical.
2. Turn on the pumps and make sure that both the water pump and coagulant/dye pumps are running in the clockwise direction.
3. Ensure both pumps are on "INT" mode.
4. Set the water pump to 38.9 rpm and the dye/coagulant pump to 20 rpm.
5. Set up camera and connect it to the computer. If it does not show up, click Force IP.

 Setting up the camera
 * Unscrew the caps from both ends of the camera and the camera holding device connected to the computer.
 * Screw the camera onto the holding device
 * Attention: It is very important that no finger prints are left on any of the lenses of the camera to ensure no disruption in the footage


### Experiment
1. Check that the flow cell is cleared of any old flocs, free of air bubbles and properly set up in its mount with the outlet side down.
2. Turn on both of the pumps.
3. Let the pumps run until flocs begin to form.
4. Keeping the pumps running, start recording a video using the Point Grey FlyCap Software.

### Running FlyCap Software
1. Open the Point Grey FlyCap software.
2. Make sure that the camera is connected to the computer and shows up as the recording device on the screen.
3. Zoom in or out of the footage screen to adjust to the full capacity of the video dimensions.
4. Click record.
5. When the new window opens up check that the file path is directed in the proper folder location.
6. Change the "Image" tab to the "Video" tab and select "MPEG" from the drop down menu.
7. Click the button below the file type and it should automatically select the appropriate values for the file type.
8. Click "Start Recoring" at the bottom of the window.
  * Check that the number of "Corrupted Images" remains low and the number of "Saved Images" increases accordingly.
  * Do not record for too long as the video may not save properly if it is too large.

### Cleaning Procedure
1. Obtain a bucket and fill it with clean, cold water. Place it on a stand to put it at the height of the flow cell mount.
  * Cold water is necessary to minimized dissolved oxygen levels. This will prevent air bubble formation in the flow cell later.
2. Turn the valves of the inlet (Blue) and outlet (Red) hoses to the open positions (vertical handle).
3. Turn on just the water pump to flush out the system of chemicals.
4. Submerge the flow cell in the bucket of cold water and open the flow cell by unscrewing all ten screws.
5. Clean the flow cell using glass cleaner and paper towels.
6. While maintaining the flow cell underwater, reassemble the flow cell with proper silicon and wire orientation. Screw all 10 screws tightly.
    - Check that neither the outlet or inlet holes are covered by the silicone piece. The silicone piece can slide around during this step.
    - Some screws may not slide in easily due to alignment. Loosely attach all ten screww, then tighten for better alignment. Use philips screwdriver.
7. If air bubbles are trapped, tap the sides of the flow cell with the outlet facing up to allow bubbles to exit upwards. DO NOT tap the face as it may damage the surface and decrease visibility in the footage.  
8. Turn off pumps if no experiments are to follow immediately after cleaning. If experiments are to follow immediately, switch the dye and coagulant pump on and begin experiment.

## Experimental Checklist
* Check that the coagulant and dye are plugged into their proper pump tubings.
* Check that the flow cell is cleaned and free of air bubbles.
* Check that both the inlet and outlet valves are open.
* Check that the flow cell inlet and outlet are not covered by the silicone sheet.
* Check that the headloss adjustment is at the proper height.

### Variables
$p$: pressure \
$\rho$: density of the fluid (water)\
$g$: gravity \
$h$: head loss \
$L$: length of tubing \
$\mu$: dynamic viscosity of the fluid (water) \
$Q$: flow rate\
$D$: Diameter of tube \

The equations for pressure:
$$\Delta p = \rho g \Delta h $$
$$\Delta p = \frac{128L}{\pi} \frac{\mu Q}{D^4}$$
**To calculate head loss**:
$$\Delta h = \frac{128L}{\rho g\pi} \frac{\mu Q}{D^4}$$

First if we were to model one constriction with the average velocity through the pores of the filter column.

```python
from aide_design.play import *
import math as m
from scipy import constants
V_filter = 1.85*u.mm/u.s
A_filter = (0.5*u.mm)**2
Q_filter = V_filter*A_filter
Q_filter.to(u.ul/u.min)

L = 275*u.cm
g = constants.g*u.m/(u.s)**2
rho = 1*u.g/(u.cm)**3
mu = 8.90*(10**(-4))*u.Pa *u.s
D =  0.042*u.inch
deltah = (128*L*mu*Q_filter)/(rho*g*m.pi*D**4)
deltah.to(u.cm)

```
0.36 cm of head loss

This head loss is too small to be able to adjust with the height of the waste tube, and therefore the team must find another solution. The first possible solution is to use a row of sand grains and then model the constriction through multiple pores. This allows us to increase the flow rate through the flow cell and thus have a higher, more manageable head loss.

```python
Q_sand = 555*u.ul/u.min
deltah_sand = (128*L*mu*Q_sand)/(rho*g*m.pi*D**4)
deltah_sand.to(u.cm)
```
7.26 cm of head loss

```python
# If we use an entire roll of micro tubing
L2 = 100*u.feet
deltah2 = (128*L2*mu*Q_sand)/(rho*g*m.pi*D**4)
deltah2.to(u.cm)
```
80 centimeters of head loss.
