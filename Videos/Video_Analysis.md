### 26 April 2018
#### Video 1
Summary: Small flocs with traversal times of 0.35s pass through a blurry constriction.

General info:
- Flocs appear at 0:38
- Flocs are mostly small, with some slightly larger

Constriction behavior:
- The constriction's edge appears blurrier than the channel's walls

Speed:
- Velocity is high; flocs spend ~0.35s traversing the visible segment of the channel.
  - This was determined with the ratio of 31 clicks per second, with a click being a mouse-click on Jonathan's laptop. A floc traversed the channel after 11 clicks, equating to 0.35s


#### Video 2
Summary: Flocs bounce off the channel's walls and pass under the constriction, with a traversal time of 1.03s.

General info:
  - Most flocs pass through the channel within the first 10 seconds of the video; later flocs are very small

Constriction behavior:
  - Flocs bounce off of the channel's walls
  - Flocs pass under the constriction
      - Could imply that the constriction was cut at an angle, forming an undercut through which flocs passed

Speed:
- The floc traversal period is 32 clicks or 1.03s

### 24 April 2018
#### Video 1
Summary: Flocs move quickly through a tight channel, encountering a bubble.

General info:
  - Flocs are visible 0:11 ~ 0:13

Constriction behavior:
  - A bubble is visible in the channel immediately after the constriction
  -  Very tight channel (thin)

Speed:
- Flocs move with a high velocity
- Velocity was too fast to measure in this video. Not much can be inferred from this vide

#### Video 2
Summary: Large flocs move quickly through an uneven constriction.

General info:
  - Flocs look larger in this video; reason unknown

Constriction behavior:
  - The difference in thickness of the silicone at the constriction is visible
  -  The alleged constriction is the same width as the channel itself. It only appears to be a constriction because of the divet preceding the constriction

Speed:
  - The velocity is still high, but slightly slower than in Video 1

### 10 April 2018
#### Video 1
Summary: In shaky, over-exposed footage, flocs pass through two constrictions; more settle at the wider, more gradual constriction, or at the subsequent "hook".

General info:
- Video experiences wavering due to the impact of the peristaltic pumps
- Exposure seems to be too high to be able to see the small flocs, if they do exist

Constriction behavior:
- There are two constrictions in this channel. The tighter constriction seems to hold fewer flocs than the wider, more gradual constriction
- Improperly cut silicone "hook" right after the wider constriction is capturing flocs
  - Could be an issue because this is an unintentional portion of the flow cell

### 9 April 2018
#### Video 1
Summary: Barely visible flocs move quickly through the channel.

General info:
- High velocity flocs; flocs are only visible at 0:03  

### 29 March 2018
#### Video 1 (Changing Height)
Summary: Flocs at medium-speed deposit at sand-particle constrictions.

General info:
- There are flocs already stuck to the channel's walls when the video starts
- The metal arm's height was changed during the video

Constriction behavior:
- Flocs deposit at 0:04

Speed:
- Flocs don't move too quickly, but they aren't as slow as they should be


### 23 March 2018
#### Video 2 (High Inflow)
Summary: Many small flocs are occasionally captured by a constriction; larger flocs fracture and either settle or pass through the channels.

General info:
- There are any small flocs

Constriction behavior:
  - Only some flocs are captured by the constriction
Speed:
- Velocity is at the proper rate. Flocs speed up as they approach the sand grains
  - Cross sectional area changes, thus the velocity changes in order to maintain the same volumetric flow
- Larger flocs fracture; they either continue traveling through the channel, or settle onto sand grains
  - At 0:02
  - Dense, medium sized flocs settle most often without any breakage
- Very small flocs may be attaching to larger deposited flocs or settle behind the sand grains. Unclear because many small flocs go into the sand rows but much less come out of the other end

### 22 March 2018
#### Video 1
Summary: Large chunks of flocs deposit and condense, while smaller flocs pass through the channels.

General info:
- Shaky video
- Flocs are very large or come in groups/chunks

Constriction behavior:
- Chunks of flocs all deposit together in the same area; they condense as the top layer keeps coming down and the bottom layer has no where to go

Speed:
- A few small flocs approach the sand and speed up as they moves through the sand layer


#### Video 2
Summary: Large flocs build up preferentially on the left side of the sand-layer.

General info:
- There are some pulsations in flow
- Monstrously large flocs
- The video starts with a large floc buildup on the middle/right side; that entire chunk collapses and passes through the constriction at 0:12, after which flocs begin to deposit on the left side.
- There are air bubbles after the sand constriction. They do not seem to affect flow

Constriction behavior:
- The floc layer builds up preferentially on the sand layer's left side
  - Some flocs continue to settle on this mass, but the streamlines seem to direct flow towards the gap (described in the next bullet point)
- There is one gap on the right side where there is only one layer of sand grains. There is something similar on the left side as well. Flocs preferentially flow through these sections


Speed:
- Flow velocity increases as the flocs approach the constriction

#### Video 3
Summary: Large flocs move slowly without depositing.

General info:
- Monstrous flocs

Constriction behavior:
- Not much deposition, except at 0:02

Speed:
- Very slow

##### Video 4

General info:
-  Large air bubble on the middle-left side
  - Flocs seem to move aorund the bubble
  - Almost acts like another sand grain

Timeline:
- 0:01 large floc deposits almost linearly in its line of movement
- 0:37 small floc deposits as it goes between the air bubble and another floc
- 0:47 a small, oblong floc deposits from the right side of the air bubble onto a sand grain just under the bubble
- 1:07 An oblong floc kind of deposits
  - One side seems to attach on to a sand particle and pivots about that point and then the floc falls off of the sand and flows through

### 20 March 2018
#### Video 1
Summary: Large flocks settle and compress on top of the sand  layer.

General info:
- Flocs are large chunks, and they follow the same path as they get closer to the sand layer

Constriction behavior:
- The flocs stray from the edges of the sand grains; they move toward the middle of the intersections between sand grains
  - This may be because the velocity at the sand's edge is zero

### 16 March 2018
Summary: Just images; no videos, although the sand grains are optimally spaced.


### 15 March 2018
#### Video 1 (Moving Arm)
General info:
- The metal arm was moved throughout this video. As the metal arm lowered, more flocs entered and settled in the flow cell.

Constriction behavior:
- The flocs that pass through the sand layer are all very small (probably, only small flocs are *able* to pass through without being filtered)
- Flocs first occupy the top layer of constrictions, then lower ones; meanwhile, flocs build up above the very top layer, in tower-like formations.
  - Could imply that the flocs have the highest chance of depositing at the top. It's possible that as time passes, more flocs can be caught at the bottom of the sand layer.


#### Video 2
Summary: Slow flocs are forced through the constriction.

General info:
- Slow movement; this might indicate a smaller pressure difference
- 0:15 ~ 0:17 the entire floc blanket is forced down (unclear if table moved or the metal arm was moved); the flocs become more compact after this impact
  - This could tell us that flocs and the floc blanket are prone to movement by forces other than the water flow


#### Video 3
Summary: Slow flocs follow similar paths and deposit in the sand bed's deeper layers.

General info:
- Some flocs have aleady settled by the time the video starts
- Slow floc flow; flocs all follow similar paths as they approach the sand layer.
  - This is further evidence that flocs move faster near a constriction and follow ideal paths based on sand placement

Constriction behavior:
- It seems like flocs settle in the deeper layers of the sand bed, not just the top

### 13 March 2018

#### Video 1 (Adjustable arm at max)
Summary: Flocs preferentially flow through large gaps between sand particles.

General info:
- There are large gaps between sand grains
- The video pans upward, far above the sand bed, to show how sand grains stick to the acrylic and form constrictions of their own
- This flow cell uses a thin silicone spacer, which allows for flocs  to stick on the acrylic wall and act as the sand grains do and collect more flocs
    - If it weren't the thin silicone sheet, the flocs could easily flow past the floc-accumulated wall because there would be a larger depth in the flow cell

Constriction behavior:
- Flocs preferentially flow through large gaps between sand grains, rather than depositing in the surrounding sand bed
  - This video doesn't show much deposition, because most of the flocs just move towards and through the gaps

#### Video 2 (Moving View)
Summary: Flocs pass through gaps and enter a high-velocity eddy after the sand layer. 

General info:
- Video of the area below the sand layer

Constriction behavior:
- There is a visible eddy of a very high velocity
- Flocs have accumulated on the wall by these eddies. There are thick lines of flocks at the edge of these accumulations, probably because of the repeated floc deposition from the rotating eddy
- As in Video 1, some flocs flow through gaps between sand grains, and other flocs are accumulated on the acrylic wall
  - The gap allows for preferential flow straight to the eddy. The gap and high velocity could also be the causes of the eddy
