# Filter_Constrictions
## Team Members:
Thomas Bradford (tsb49)
Jacqueline Dokko (jmd475)
Jonathan Harris (jdh345)

## Semester Goals:
Research the theories of how clay particles are filtered within the stacked rapid sand filters at the microscopic level by using a flow cell to model clay-sand interactions at constrictions between sand particles.
